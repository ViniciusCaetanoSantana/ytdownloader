### In this project I made a youtube music and video downloader. I used the "pytube" and "os" library.


## Things that you can do:

+ Download a single video with mp3 or mp4 extension
+ Download a full playlist of videos with mp3 or mp4 extension


## How to use the application:

+ Write in the first input the number of links that you will use (how many videos or playlist you will download)
+ Paste the links at the second input
+ Write in the third input if you will download it with mp3 or mp4 extension
+ For each link you must write the extension that you want to download (mp3 or mp4)


# If there is an error the code will advise you
